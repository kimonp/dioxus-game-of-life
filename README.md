# Dioxus Game Of Life
An implementation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using the Dioxus framework,
ported from the [rust wasm tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/introduction.html).

While the code from the original tutorial is about 50% rust, 50% JavaScript, with the Dioxus framework the code can be 100% Rust.
